    <h1>Tic Tac Toe Information</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! Here are the rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is played on a 3x3 grid.</li>
        <li>Two players take turns to place their markers (X or O) on the grid.</li>
        <li>The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.</li>
        <li>If all the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.</li>
    </ul>


    You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.
